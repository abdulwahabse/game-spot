## How did I build it?

"Game Spot" is a React application built using TypeScript. Axios is employed to facilitate seamless data retrieval from the server, while Chakra-UI is used for efficient and visually pleasing styling. The project's architecture prioritizes modularization and follows best practices for TypeScript and React development.

## What problem did I set out to fix?

The primary aim of "Game Spot" was to create a platform for users to explore video games and associated content with a focus on smooth data retrieval from the server. By utilizing TypeScript and Axios, the project seeks to provide a responsive and well-structured solution for fetching and displaying game-related information.

## What were some of the design decisions?

Several design decisions were made to optimize the user experience. The selection of Chakra-UI for styling was made to expedite development and improve the overall visual appeal of the application. The project's core objective is to practice TypeScript, API integration, and CSS library usage effectively.

## What packages did I use to solve challenges?

To address the challenges of efficient data fetching and styling, I leveraged specific packages and technologies. TypeScript ensures a type-safe development process, while Axios streamlines server communication. Chakra-UI provides a robust foundation for creating a visually appealing user interface while maintaining code modularity.

## What did I learn?

Throughout the development of "Game Spot," I acquired valuable experience in TypeScript, Axios, and Chakra-UI. I gained insights into structuring React projects more effectively and modularly. The project served as a practical exercise for honing skills related to data fetching, TypeScript development, and utilizing CSS libraries for enhanced styling.

## What will I do differently next time?

For future iterations or similar projects, I plan to explore different styling approaches, such as using TailwindCSS, to diversify my skill set. Additionally, I will consider adopting Next.js for improved server-side rendering and enhanced performance, further enhancing the project's capabilities and user experience.
